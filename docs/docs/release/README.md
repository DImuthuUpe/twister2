## Road map

We have started working on our next major release that will connect the core components we have developed 
into a full data analytics environment. In particular it will focus on providing APIs around the core
capabilities of Twister2 and integration of applications in a single dataflow. 

1. Implementing core parts of Twister2 with C/C++ for high performance 
2. Python API
3. Direct use of RDMA
4. SQL interface 
5. Native MPI support for cloud deployments
6. FT for standalone version

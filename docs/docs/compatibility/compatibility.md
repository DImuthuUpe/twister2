# Twister2 Compatibility APIs

Twister2 is designed to be a generic execution platform for data analytics. We expect Twister2 to 
support different API's developed by different projects. We have added the Apache Storm support as 
of now and looking to add more API's in the future.

1. [Apache Storm API](storm.md)
2. [Apache Beam API](beam.md)
3. [Python API](beam.md)

## Future Possibilities

1. SQL API
2. Python API

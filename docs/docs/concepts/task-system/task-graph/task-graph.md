# Task Graph

The task graph is the preferred choice for the processing of large-scale data. It simplifies the 
process of task parallelism and has the ability to dynamically determine the dependency between 
those tasks. The nodes in the task graph consist of task vertices and edges in which task vertices 
represent the computational units of an application and edges represent the communication edges 
between those computational units. In other words, it describes the details about how the data is 
consumed between those units. Each node in the task graph holds the information about the input and 
its output. The task graph is converted into an execution graph once the actual execution takes place.

## Task Graph in Twister2

The task layer provides a higher-level abstraction on top of the communication layer to hide the 
underlying details of the execution and communication from the user. Computations are modeled as 
task graphs in the task layer which could be created either statically or dynamically. A node in 
the task graph represents a task whereas an edge represents the communication link between the vertices.
Each node in the task graph holds the information about the input and its output. A task could be 
long-running (streaming graph) or short-running (dataflow graph without loops) depending on the type 
of application. A task graph 'TG' generally consists of set of Task Vertices'TV' and Task Edges \(TE\) which is 
mathematically denoted as Task Graph

(TG) -> (TV, TE)

## Static and Dynamic Task Graphs 

The task graphs can be defined in two ways namely static and dynamic task graph. 
 * Static task graph - the structure of the complete task graph is known at compile time.
 * Dynamic task graph - the structure of the task graph does not know at compile time and the program 
   dynamically define the structure of the task graph during run time.
 
The following three essential points should be considered while creating and scheduling the task 
instances of the task graph.

1. Task Decomposition - Identify independent tasks which can execute concurrently
2. Group tasks - Group the tasks based on the dependency of other tasks.
3. Order tasks - Order the tasks which will satisfy the constraints of other tasks.

## Directed Task Graph and Undirected Task Graph

There are two types of task graphs namely directed task graph and undirected task graph. In directed
task graph, the edges in the task graph that connects the task vertexes have a direction as shown 
in Fig.1 whereas in undirected task graph, the edges in the task graph that connects the task 
vertexes have no direction as shown in Fig 2. The present task system supports only directed dataflow 
task graph.

## Streaming Task Graph

Stream refers the process of handling unbounded sequence of data units. The streaming application 
that can continuosly consumes input stream units and produces the output stream units. The streaming
task graph is mainly responsible for building and executing the streaming applications.

## Batch Task Graph

Batch processing refers the process of handling bounded sequence of data units. Batch applications 
mainly consumes bounded data units and produces the data units. The batch task graph is mainly 
responsible for building and executing the batch applications.

## Task Graph in Twister2

* The task graph system in Twister2 is mainly aimed to support the directed dataflow task graph 
  which consists of task vertices and task edges. 
   * The task vertices represent the source and target task vertex 
   * The task edge represent the edges to connect the task vertices
   
* The task graph in Twister2  
  * supports iterative data processing - For example, in K-Means clustering algorithm, at the end of 
    every iteration, data points and centroids are stored in the DataSet which will be used for the 
    next iteration 
  * It doesnâ€™t allow loops or self-loops or cycles
    
* It describes the details about how the data is consumed between the task vertices.  
  * Source Task - It extends the BaseSource and implements the Receptor interface which is given below.
  * Compute Task - It implements the IFunction interface which is given below.
  * Sink Task - It extends the BaseSink and implements the Collector interface. 

## Implementation Details

### ITaskGraph

It is the main interface which is primarily responsible for creating task vertexes and task edges 
between those vertexes, removing task vertexes and task edges, and others.

### BaseDataflowTaskGraph

It is the base class for the dataflow task graph which consists of methods to find out the inward 
and outward task edges and incoming and outgoing task edges. It validates the task vertexes and 
creates the directed dataflow edge between the source and target task vertexes. It also performs the 
validation such as duplicate names for the task, duplicate edges between same two tasks, 
self-loop in the task graph, and cycles in the task graph. Some of the main methods available in 
this class are

```text
     addTaskVertex(TV sourceTaskVertex, TV targetTaskVertex)

     addTaskEge(TV sourceTaskVertex, TV targetTaskVertex, TE taskEges)

     removeTaskVertex(TV taskVertex), removeTaskEdge(TE taskEdge)

     validateTaskVertex(TV source/target vertex)
            
     boolean detectSelfLoop(Set<TV> taskVertex)
            
     detectCycle(TV vertex, Set<TV> taskVertexSet, Set<TV> sourceTaskSet, Set<TV> targetTaskSet)
            
     boolean containsTaskEdge(TE taskEdge)
```

### DataflowTaskGraph

It is the main class which extends the BaseDataflowTaskGraph, first it validate the task graph then 
store the directed edges into the task map which consists of source task vertex and target task vertex..

### DirectedEdge

It is responsible for creating the directed task edge between the task vertices. 

### Vertex

It represents the characteristics of a task instance. It consists of task name, cpu, ram, memory, 
parallelism, and others.

### Edge

Edge represents the communication operation to be performed between two task vertices. It consists 
of edge name, type of operation, operation name, and others.

### GraphBuilder

The graph builder is the mainly responsible for creating the dataflow task graph which has the 
methods for connecting the task vertexes, add the configuration values, setting the parallelism, and 
validate the task graph.

### Operation Mode

The operation mode supports two types of task graphs namely streaming and batch.

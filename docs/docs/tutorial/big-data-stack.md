# Decoupling Big Data Solutions (Big Data Stack)


Big data has been characterized by the ever-increasing velocity, volume, and veracity of the data generated from various sources, ranging from web
users to Internet of Things devices to large scientific equipment. The data have to be processed as individual streams and analyzed collectively,
either in streaming or batch settings for knowledge discovery with both database queries and sophisticated machine learning. These applications
need to run as services in cloud environments as well as traditional high performance clusters. With the proliferation of cloud-based systems and
Internet of Things, fog computing  is adding another dimension to these applications where part of the processing has to occur near the devices

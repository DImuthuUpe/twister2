Twister2 provides a data analytics hosting environment where it supports differet data analytcs including streaming, data pipelines and iterative computations. 

Unlike many other big data systems that are desinged around user APIs, Twister2 is built from bottom up to support different APIs and workloads. Our vision for Twister2 as a complete computuing environment for data analytics can be found in the figure below.

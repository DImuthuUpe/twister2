# Twister2 Overview


Twister2 provides a data analytics hosting environment where it supports different data analytics
including streaming, data pipelines and iterative computations.

Unlike many other big data systems that are designed around user APIs, Twister2 is built from bottom
up to support different APIs and workloads. Our vision for Twister2 is a complete computing
 environment for data analytics.

One major goal of Twister2 is to provide independent components, that can be used by other
big data systems and evolve separately.


Twister2 can be deployed both in HPC and cloud environments. When deployed in a HPC environment, it
can use OpenMPI for its communications. It can be programmed at different levels depending on the
application types giving the user the flexibility to use underlying features.

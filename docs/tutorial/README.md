# Tutorial on Twister2 for 5th International Winter School on Big Data


In this tutorial, we review big data problems and systems,
explain Twister2 architecture and features,
provide examples for developing and running applications
on Twister2 system. By learning Twister2,
big data developers will have an experience with a
flexible big data solution that can be used to
solve all three types of big data problems.

Twister2 provides a data analytics hosting environment where it supports different data analytics
including streaming, data pipelines and iterative computations.

Unlike many other big data systems that are designed around user APIs, Twister2 is built from bottom
up to support different APIs and workloads. Our vision for Twister2 is a complete computing
 environment for data analytics.

One major goal of Twister2 is to provide independent components, that can be used by other
big data systems and evolve separately.

Twister2 is an ongoing open source project at Indiana University. It started in the
4th quarter of 2017.

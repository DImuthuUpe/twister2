#Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithm usage is intensively done nowadays. Our goal is to provide infrastructure
and APIs for users to get their analysis done much faster in an easy way. Currently, Twister2 APIs 
only support two machine learning algorithms and we are working on expanding this up to multiple 
algorithms in the upcoming releases.  

We have designed two main machine learning examples.

1. [KMeans](kmeans/kmeans.md)
2. [Support Vector Machines](svm/svm.md)
